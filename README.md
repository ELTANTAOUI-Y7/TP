# TP Repository

This repository contains the solutions for the C++ module assignments. Each folder represents a specific TP (Travaux Pratiques) session.

## Folder Structure

TP / TP1_Yahya_EL-TANTAOUI / main.cpp # Contains all the solutions for TP1 exercises and so on.

## How to Run the Files

Each folder contains a main.cpp file, which includes the solutions for all the exercises in that TP. To specify which exercise to run, a macro called EXO is used. This macro defines the exercise to be executed.

## Steps to Run

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the folder of the desired TP:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/TP[number]_Yahya_EL-TANTAOUI
3. Compile and run the file using the g++ command, specifying the exercise number (i) with the -DEXO flag.
   
   For example to run exercise 3:
      ```bash
      g++ main.cpp -DEXO=3 -o output && ./output
5. The program will execute the solution for the specified exercise.
